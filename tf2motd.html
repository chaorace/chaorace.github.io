		<h2>Current Restrictions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>No sniper rifles -- Huntsman allowed</li>
			<li>No Loch-n-Load</li>
			<li>No mini-sentries</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Why Restrictions?</h3>
		<p>
			Simply put, weapons that can gimp light classes tend to create unfun, unavoidable deaths when wielded by a skilled player.
			Our goal, that is, to create a fun environment for people to play how they want, is at direct odds with weapons that are uninteractive (sniper rifle, minis) or simply very strong (loch-n-load).
			The theory of the relationship between interactivity and enjoyment is one that stems heavily from card-games design theory, it's a pretty interesting subject and I adhere to a lot of the ideas it presents.
			As always, you can send complaints to chaorace@gmail.com, I'll read all of them
