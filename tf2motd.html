			We are a Payload/CP oriented server aimed at delivering a vanilla+ experience! <br />
			Currently looking for competent community managers!

		<h2>Commands</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>rtv - Vote to skip the current map</li>
			<li>nominate (mapname) - Nominate a map to appear in the vote for next map</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Current Restrictions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>No sniper rifles -- Huntsman allowed</li>
			<li>No Loch-n-Load</li>
			<li>No mini-sentries</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Why Restrictions?</h3>
		<p>
			Simply put, weapons that can gimp light classes tend to create unfun, unavoidable deaths when wielded by a skilled player. <br />
			Our goal, that is, to create a fun environment for people to play how they want, is at direct odds with weapons that are uninteractive (sniper rifle, minis) or simply very strong (loch-n-load). <br />
			The theory of the relationship between interactivity and enjoyment is one that stems heavily from card-games design theory, it's a pretty interesting subject and I adhere to a lot of the ideas it presents. <br />
