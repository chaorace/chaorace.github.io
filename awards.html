					<br />
					To Whom It May Concern,
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					Please accept the following as my recommendation for <b>Christopher L. Crockett.</b>
					<br />
					<br />
					As his teacher of Economics and Government, I found Christopher to be an exceptional student.
					He is respectful, diligent, inquisitive, and responsible.
					He possesses high level academic skills that put him well above his class peers in academic
					achievement and though he could have easily passed these classes with that much personal
					effort, Christopher chose to consistently demonstrate a very mature approach to inquiry
					and problem solving, as well as a highly motivated persistence in meeting the challenges
					and goals that I established for his class.
					<br />
					<br />
					In addition to his academic qualities, Christopher works well with others in group activities.
					His willingness to work cooperatively toward a common goal is a refreshing contrast to the
					self-indulgence we see too often in his peers. His sense of responsibility is obvious,
					and his dedication to principle and standards set him apart. He has and shows sincere
					respect for himself, for his peers, and for his teachers.
					<br />
					<br />
					It has been my experience with Christopher that he possesses the skills and attitude that
					make him an exemplary employee, and I sincerely hope that you will consider giving him
					the opportunity.
					<br />
					<br />
					Thank you for your time and consideration. If I can be of any further assistance in this
					matter, please feel free to contact me at the e-mail address below.
					<br />

					Dear Sir or Madam,
					<br />
					<br />
					I am writing in concern to Chris Crockett. Chris has been and currently is a
					Science student of mine at North Cobb High School. I have had Chris for two semesters, and
					will have him again for a third. In conjunction with having Chris as a student, he has also
					served in the capacity of being a class mentor. Chris is exceptional in his academics, as well as
					doing an excellent job of tutoring computer programming students. Chris has also taken the
					initiative to charter an after school club, in which participation by classmates is very high.
					Chris shows a maturity level well above that of his peers. That, along with his character and
					being incredibly responsible, makes Chris a very trustworthy individual. I have no hesitation
					in recommending Chris for an employment position with your organization. If you have any
					questions, feel free to call me (770-877-2288). Thank you for any consideration.
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					Sincerely,
					<br />
					Matt Tener
					<br />
					Computer Science Instructor
					<br />
					North Cobb High School
