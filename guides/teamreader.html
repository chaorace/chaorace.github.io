		<h3>Step Zero: Let Go of Your Earthly Bonds</h3>
		<guideText>
			This guide features code (sloppily) written by me! That means you need to acknowledge that I'm not responsible for the hell it may or may not unleash upon the innocent people of the Earth!
			Once you've confirmed with yourself and your family that you're okay with this, please continue.
		</guideText>
		<h3>Step One: Download and install eSpeak by Jonathan Duddington</h3>
		<guideText>
			Did I mention that <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/">eSpeak</a> is made by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/u/jonsd/profile/">Jonathan Duddington?</a> Because he's a pretty cool guy for making such a lightweight and flexible TTS program under the GPL and all that.
			Anyways, you're going to have install his software. TeamReader was designed and tested using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/espeak/files/espeak/espeak-1.48/setup_espeak-1.48.04.exe/download">version 1.48.04</a>, but feel free to try a newer version if you want.
			It should still work unless the command-line version of the application is removed or drastically changed. The TeamReader software <i>does</i>, however, expect eSpeak to be installed in the default directory, so please install it there.
		</guideText>
		<h3>Step Two: Download, unpack, and run TeamReader by me</h3>
		<guideText>
			You can unpack TeamReader anywhere you like, but I recommend putting it somewhere where you won't lose it. Once you've finished reading the README.txt file, double-click TeamReader.bat to start the program.
			It is very important that you do not start the program using TeamReader.jar, because it's much harder to close the program when you're done.
		</guideText>
		<h3>Step Three: Use Teamspeak like you usually would</h3>
		<guideText>
			Now the software should transcribe all chat messages to audio. It even supports multiple servers at once! Simply play like usual and enjoy!
